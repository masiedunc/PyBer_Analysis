# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to provide V. Isualize, the CEO of the ride-sharing company with an analysis of 2019 fares based on city type. The results of this analysis will provide a summary of total rides, drivers, and fares as well as the average fare per ride and per driver. The weekly fares between January 2019 and April 2019 are visualized in a line graph to assist the ride-sharing company in making decisions for the future of the company. 

## Results
Referring to Figure 1, you can see the data for= total rides, total drivers, and total fares followed by average fare per ride and driver. An obvious difference is that total rides, drivers, and fares for Urban cities are significantly higher than those for Rural or Suburban cities. However, the opposite is true for the average fares. Rural cities have higher fare rates per ride and driver than both Suburban and Urban cities.

When analyzing the weekly fares between January and April 2019, interestingly we found that the total fares in Urban cities were higher than the Suburban and Rural cities. Even though our earlier findings displayed average fares are higher, the total fare, in $USD, in Urban cities was significantly higher, which could mean the total number of rides was higher.

## Summary
Based on the findings in the analysis of the ride-sharing data, there are ways to decrease the stark differences between the city types when it comes to fare prices and total rides. Firstly, the rates for the fares in the Urban cities could possibly be increased to match or at least lessen the gap with suburban/rural cities. This would not only bring in more revenue, yet also allow for the opportunity for drivers in urban cities to collect the same pay as rural drivers. On the other hand, the total number of divers could be the factor that is increased in suburban and rural cities, which could help reduce the fare per ride, which could have the potential to lead to more rides. Lastly, based on events within each city type, special promotions or pricing could be initiated to allow drivers to charge more for rides during busy events. For example, sporting events tend to lead to more people traveling to urban cities, sometimes from suburban or rural areas, and while the fares are typically lower per ride in urban areas, these events could allow drivers to charge more per ride. Expanding the analysis to the full year along with focusing on recurring and/or popular events could provide insight into trends of the total rides during those times.
