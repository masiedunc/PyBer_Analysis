# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to provide V. Isualize, the CEO of the ride-sharing company with an analysis of 2019 fares based on city type. The results of this analysis will provide a summary of total rides, drivers, and fares as well as the average fare per ride and per driver. The weekly fares between January 2019 and April 2019 are visualized in a line graph to assist the ride-sharing company in making decisions for the future of the company. 

## Results
Referring to Figure 1, you can see the data for= total rides, total drivers, and total fares followed by average fare per ride and driver. An obvious difference is that total rides, drivers, and fares for Urban cities are significantly higher than those for Rural or Suburban cities. However, the opposite is true for the average fares. Rural cities have higher fare rates per ride and driver than both Suburban and Urban cities.

When analyzing the weekly fares between January and April 2019, interestingly we found that the total fares in Urban cities were higher than the Suburban and Rural cities. Even though our earlier findings displayed average fares are higher, the total fare, in $USD, in Urban cities was significantly higher, which could mean the total number of rides was higher.
